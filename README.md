# Loan-Default-Model
A ML based predictive model for loan defaults. The project uses different machine learning techniques - 1. Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification Trees, Ensembles (Classification Methods), Lasso (Regularisation Technique), 10-fold Cross-Validation (ML technique used to train effectively our classifiers splitting the population into training and testing samples).

**1. Initial requirements**

In order to make use of the project, the user should have a Matlab- version R2016b installed on their PC, so that they can compile and run the codes included in this repository.

**2. Getting started**

In order to run the model the user needs to follow the following easy steps:
- Extract the information from the file named `LCloanbook.rar` into your local directory (make sure that all the files are saved in one place)
- Open and run the file called `loan_Default_Model.m`
- Allthe test results should appear in the bottom left corner of your screen (the work space)
- Enjoy! :)

**3. Repository constituents**

- `loan_Default_Model.m` - The Matlab code including the definitions of the different Machine Learning techniques used in this model.
- `LCloanbook.rar` - The actual underlying loan data and variables descriptions 
- `README.md` - the file that you are currently reading
